Comparative Programming Languages

I was introduced to the essential programming concepts that modern programming languages were designed on n this module.
The aim of this module was to have me understand design choices in current programming languages and understand language features.

Some of the skills I gained throughout this module include:

1. How to explain the essential concepts underpinning modern programming languages.
2. How to evaluate a programming language with respect to its design choices and appropriateness for a given programming task
3. How to implement a fundamental programming task and data structure in an imperative and declarative fashion
4. How to compare a procedural programming language with an object oriented programming language within the context of programming language design concepts
5. How to compare a functional programming language with a logic programming language within the context of programming language design concepts
6. How to evaluate one programming language in detail within the programming language design and implementation (i.e. Typing and Scope, Pointers and Memory Management, Abstraction)

Both assignments included in this repository are comparative reflections of types of programming languages which were completed on a practical basis.

I recieved an overall grade of 82% for this module.
